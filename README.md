# Tic-Tac-Toe 🕹️

A simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Python for the console. My first GitHub project!

## How to Play
1. Run the game in your terminal: `python tictactoe.py`
2. Player X starts. Enter row (1-3) and column (1-3) when prompted.
3. Get three in a row, column, or diagonal to win!
4. The game detects wins, draws, and offers a replay.

## Features
- Clean board display that clears the screen each turn.
- Input validation to prevent bad moves.
- Modular code for easy reading.

## Requirements
- Python 3 (no extra libraries needed beyond standard os).
